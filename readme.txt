Provides up and downvote buttons to each of your posts.

== Description ==

This plugin provides one upvote( like ) and one downvote( dislike ) button with counter, to each of your posts. The site admin has option to set the position ( before or after a post ) and orientation( left or right ) of these buttons.

The site admin has the option to set the voting mode per post. Each post can either be "restricted", i.e. is votable by only a logged in registered user, or, "open", i.e. any visitor can cast her vote for the post. For the posts in "open" mode, the site admin can set a time interval for a user to cast consecutive votes for a particular post. The logged in user can optionally be allowed to cast multiple votes for a single post, or, to vote a post only once. If she is allowed ( by the option set by the site admin ) to cast multiple votes for a particular post, she is prevented for the pre-set time interval to cast a consecutive vote.

The admin interface has a complete list of all the posts that have been voted so far and she can reset the counters for either a particular post or multiple posts at a time.

Other settings provide options to specify the number of posts to display per listing page, etc.
